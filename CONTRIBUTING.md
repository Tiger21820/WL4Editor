# WL4Editor's Contributor's Guide
Here are some guidelines for contributing to this repository:

## In a Nutshell:
- Format code with the clang-format configuration that we provided.
- Make sure the code compiles or mark as [WIP] when making a Pull request.
- Avoid using new/delete/malloc/free/realloc, prefer smart pointers for memory management.
- Avoid using C-Style Anything.
- If you have to use C Libraries, use the C++ wrappers.
